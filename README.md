Paws is a peer-to-peer kennel service where owners can take comfort in finding like-minded pet owners who only want the best for their four-legged friends.  "Sitters" are rigorously vetted to ensure that they will provide only the best care for pets, so users will have complete peace of mind.  

With kennels being as crowded as they are, Paws is an ideal service for pet owners who need to travel but want to ensure their pets are given the best one-on-one attention by other pet owners who care about the happiness and well-being of Fido as much as they do.
